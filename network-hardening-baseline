# Network Security Hardening at NextGen Energy Solutions

##  Overview
I contributed to a network security hardening initiative aimed at reducing attack surface across NextGen Energy Solutionsâ€™ internal and external-facing systems.

##  Objectives
- Review existing firewall and access control configurations.  
- Identify unnecessary open ports and risky services.  
- Apply security best practices aligned with CIS benchmarks.  

##  Hardening Steps
1. Conducted baseline scan of network ports and services.  
2. Identified misconfigured firewall rules and excessive access permissions.  
3. Closed unnecessary ports and enforced principle of least privilege.  
4. Configured monitoring alerts for abnormal inbound/outbound traffic.  

##  Outcome
- Reduced number of exposed services accessible externally.  
- Strengthened segmentation between critical infrastructure and user networks.  
- Provided documentation for ongoing configuration reviews.  

##  Tools Used
- Nmap (port scanning)  
- Wireshark (traffic analysis)  
- Firewall management console  

##  Key Skills Demonstrated
- Network security auditing.  
- Applying CIS controls and best practices.  
- Firewall rule optimization.  
- Monitoring and alerting configuration.

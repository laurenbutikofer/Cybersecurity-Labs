# Vulnerability Scanning & Remediation at NextGen Energy Solutions

##  Overview
I assisted in scanning company assets to identify vulnerabilities, assess severity, and recommend remediations. This effort aligned with NextGenâ€™s security baseline for energy infrastructure.

##  Objectives
- Perform vulnerability scans on key systems.  
- Prioritize findings based on CVSS score and business impact.  
- Recommend remediation steps to IT administrators.   

##  Investigation Steps
1. Conducted initial scans using Nessus on corporate systems.  
2. Identified outdated software versions with known CVEs.  
3. Categorized findings into Critical, High, Medium, Low.  
4. Coordinated with IT to patch or mitigate high-risk findings.  

##  Outcome
- Reduced number of critical vulnerabilities.  
- Implemented regular monthly vulnerability scans as policy.  
- Improved patch management workflow with clear SLA timelines.  

##  Tools Used
- Nessus Essentials (vulnerability scanning)  
- CVE database (NVD)  
- Patch management platform  

##  Key Skills Demonstrated
- Vulnerability management lifecycle.  
- CVE analysis and remediation planning.

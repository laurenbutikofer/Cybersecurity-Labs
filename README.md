# Cybersecurity-Labs
This repository contains a collection of hands-on cybersecurity labs I’ve completed to practice and demonstrate practical skills in defensive security, penetration testing, and cloud security. Each lab is documented step-by-step with objectives, tools used, methods, and findings.

Repository Structure
- **/SOC-Labs/** → Security Operations Center labs (log analysis, threat hunting, SIEM work).  
- **/Pentesting-Labs/** → Offensive security labs (vulnerability discovery, exploitation, reporting).  
- **/Cloud-Security-Labs/** → Hands-on cloud security projects in AWS and Azure.  
- **/Forensics-Labs/** → Incident response and digital forensics analysis.  

Tools & Technologies
Wireshark • Splunk • ELK Stack • Suricata  
Kali Linux • Metasploit • Burp Suite  
Autopsy • Volatility • CyberChef  
AWS • Azure  

Goals
- Apply concepts from CompTIA Security+ and beyond in real-world style labs.  
- Document security workflows to demonstrate technical communication.  
- Build a public portfolio to show readiness for entry-level cybersecurity roles.  


# Real-World Experience – NextGen Energy Solutions
I documented several real-world cybersecurity projects I assisted with at NextGen Energy Solutions, focused on protecting energy-sector infrastructure.  

Case studies include:  
- [Incident Response: Phishing Attempt](./nextgen-security-projects/incident-response-phishing.md)  
- [Vulnerability Scanning & Remediation](./nextgen-security-projects/vulnerability-scanning.md)  
- [Network Security Hardening](./nextgen-security-projects/network-hardening.md)  

These projects demonstrate applied cybersecurity skills in incident response, vulnerability management, and network security hardening.
